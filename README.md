This is a chess game created purely using java. You play against computer as white. The computer plays random legal moves and is easy to defeat.

The full program is contained in chessout.java. The png files are images of pieces and squares. Those are referenced in the 
program as src/game_images. So before executing, you need to create folder in that name and move the images to it. Then just run the chess.java file and enjoy!!

Coming soon: Playable as black, strong AI.
